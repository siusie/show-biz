# Playlist-Editor
Playlist Editor is a full-stack web application that allows a user to add actors and shows. The database design and view models were built from scratch to practice back-end development skills. The goal was to build a simple application to the best of my current level of knowledge in the ASP.NET MVC framework.

## Example live site
This web app is deployed to Microsoft Azure. It can be accessed [here](https://show-biz.azurewebsites.net/). To create the web application, I used 3 Azure services:

1. A database server
2. SQL database, stored on the database server
3. Web App

Create an account to start adding actors, shows, and episodes.
